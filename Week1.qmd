# Welcome to coding in R!

![art by Allison Horst](https://cdn.myportfolio.com/45214904-6a61-4e23-98d6-b140f8654a40/ef5356a8-a9ee-4a54-9b62-7e1c4cb9f723_rw_1920.png?h=2da8ae510b02b70f895d2a79946c5f3d){fig-align="center" width="500"}

This week we are going to start by getting familiar with RMarkdown and end up reading some data into RStudio. There are a total of 10 videos to watch and each video is 10-15 min long so you can dip in and out across the week.

The idea is for you to code along with the videos, stopping and starting and troubleshooting as you go. Try the exercises Danielle recommends AND to see whether you are really getting it, have a go at the SELF TEST challenge.

For this reason, you should allocate \~ 3 hours to your coding this week.

> NOTE: Your first learning log should include a knitted .Rmd document published to Rpubs. Don't know what that means? no problem! Danielle covers how to do that in the sharing your document video (video 7) below.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this module you will be able to...

-   Find your way around RStudio and RMarkdown
-   Read data into RStudio
-   Use the pipe (%\>%) to string together group_by and summarise commands
-   Write data to a .csv file

## Getting started in RMarkdown

### The beginning

In this video, Danielle shows you how to set up an RStudio Cloud account and gives a brief intro of RMarkdown.

### Stating the problem

In this video, Danielle talks about why word documents can be problematic and why Markdown is a good solution if you want to write about science reproducibly. She also shows you how to create a new RStudio Cloud project.

Now that you have your head around RMarkdown, lets get some data into R.

### Read and glimpse your data

In this video, Danielle introduces the "reasoning" data set that she will go on to use in upcoming videos, talks about how to read data into R using `read_csv()` and view it with `print()` and `glimpse()`

### What is the "pipe"?

The pipe operator is a key component of the tidyverse. Here Danielle introduces the pipe along with some examples using `group_by()` and `summarise()`.
