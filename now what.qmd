You have made your way through all of Dani's modules but probably still feel like you don't know enough. Here are some of my favourite R learning resources.

# Data skills

## Websites

### [The R-Studio Education site](https://education.rstudio.com/)

Alison Hill and her team at RStudio have pulled together the best resources for beginners at the RStudio Education site. Cute art by Desiree de Leon make the site a joy to explore.

### [Teacup Giraffes](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html)

If you are looking for a gentle introduction to R and statistics and like a bit of cute, the statistics and teacup giraffe modules by Desiree de Leon and Hasse Walum are for you.

## Books

### [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

If books are more your scene, the free online book by Hadley Wickham great. Its definitely worth checking out this tidyverse bible.

## Videos

### [R-Ladies Sydney #RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/)

The #RYouWithMe course by R-Ladies Sydney is a series of online modules that walk you through getting data into R, cleaning it up a bit, visualising it, and reporting using RMarkdown. Lots of screencasts and practice exercises using enterococci data collected from Sydney beaches.

# Statistics

## Books

### [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/)

If you are keen to go beyond wrangling and visualising and to get some analysis done in R, Dani's book is a great place to start. It is genuinely fun to read (uncommon for a stats book) and covers basic statistical analysis. Also free and available online.

## Videos

### [Statistics of DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMdihazndR0f9XBoSXWqnYg)

If you like to watch youtube and learn stats, rather than read and learn stats, try Dr Erin Buchanan's [Statistics of DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMdihazndR0f9XBoSXWqnYg) youtube channel and associated [website](https://statisticsofdoom.com/). She is an A/Prof at Missouri State and teaches tons of stats courses and gives them all away.

### [Kelly Bodwin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCchB_GC3WYW8kuGPyllLE7Q)

Kelly Bodwin also teaches intro stats in R at CalStatePoly. Her youtube videos are also excellent.

# Practice

## PsiChi challenge

PsiChi, which is the US Hons psychology society, has a monthly R challenge on their OSF page. They use open data and set a few common data wrangling/visualisation/analysis tasks for you to complete. I've used the challenge in my lab meeting and have pulled some code templates into this [RStudio cloud project](https://posit.cloud/content/5737294)

## TidyTuesday

Each Tuesday Thomas Mock releases a dataset on the [Tidy Tuesday github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), people all over the world plot the data to show something interesting and then post their plot to twitter using the hashtag #tidytuesday. If watching an expert is your kind of fun, check out [David Robinson's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ). People have even timestamped his videos so you can find him demo almost anything.
